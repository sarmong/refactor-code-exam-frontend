# Squiz frontend testing review

This project is part of the Squiz product engineering interview process. The codebase has been written to contain multiple issues that could be identified and tested by a quality engineer.

## Scenario

Pretend you have just inherited this codebase from a team and they want you to test it for them.

The project is a simple microservice that enables people to make a list of tasks to do. The app is written in TypeScript and the team has asked you to help test it, both with manual and automated tests.

### The App

To get the app to run, please ensure you have `node 16` and `npm 7` installed. From there:

- `npm install`
- `npm run serve`

## Your tasks

1. Get the project running, manually test the app, and note down any issues you find. We will discuss the issues you have found during the interview.
2. Using Cypress, write at least one UI test that exposes an issue.

## What we're looking for

1. Your ability to use basic engineering concepts and understand an unfamiliar application
2. Your ability to identify issues with an unfamiliar application
3. Your ability to communicate what those issues are and why they're an issue
4. You ability to write a test to expose the issue so a software engineer can fix it
